# Tiptap

Tiptap is a headless, framework-agnostic rich-text editor built on top of [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/). It provides a highly customizable and extensible API for building modern WYSIWYG editors in web applications. Tiptap is popular in the JavaScript ecosystem and is often used with frameworks like Vue.js, React, and others, but can be used with plain JavaScript as well.

## What is Tiptap?
- **Tiptap** is a rich-text editor toolkit that allows developers to create fully customized editing experiences.
- It is **headless**, meaning it provides the editing logic and state management, but leaves the UI up to you.
- Built on top of **ProseMirror**, a powerful toolkit for building rich-text editors.
- Supports collaborative editing, real-time updates, and a wide range of extensions.

## Pros
- **Highly Customizable:** You can build your own UI and add custom extensions to fit your needs.
- **Framework Agnostic:** Works with Vue, React, Svelte, or plain JavaScript.
- **Active Community:** Well-maintained with frequent updates and a large user base.
- **Rich Extension Ecosystem:** Many official and community extensions (tables, mentions, images, collaborative editing, etc.).
- **Headless Architecture:** Full control over rendering and behavior.
- **Collaborative Editing:** Built-in support for real-time collaboration (with Y.js integration).
- **Mobile Friendly:** Good support for mobile devices and touch events.
- **Open Source:** Core is open source, with some advanced features available under a commercial license.

## Cons
- **Learning Curve:** Requires understanding of ProseMirror concepts and Tiptap’s extension system.
- **Documentation Gaps:** Some advanced use cases may lack detailed documentation.
- **Performance:** For very large documents or complex collaborative scenarios, performance tuning may be needed.
- **Commercial License for Some Features:** Some advanced extensions (e.g., collaboration, comments) require a paid license.
- **Headless by Default:** You must build your own UI, which can be more work compared to plug-and-play editors.

## More About Tiptap
- **Extensions:** Tiptap’s power comes from its extension system. You can use official extensions or build your own for custom nodes, marks, and commands.
- **Collaboration:** Integrates with [Y.js](https://yjs.dev/) for real-time collaborative editing.
- **Framework Support:** Official packages for [Vue.js](https://tiptap.dev/guide/vue), [React](https://tiptap.dev/guide/react), and [Svelte](https://tiptap.dev/guide/svelte).
- **Custom UI:** Since Tiptap is headless, you can design toolbars, menus, and popups exactly as you want.
- **Accessibility:** Tiptap aims to be accessible, but you are responsible for ensuring your custom UI meets accessibility standards.
